### 🎯 Estimate “clients ratio” (aprox) – amar approximation

Ekhane ratio–te ami bujhi “koto poriman proposal/offer pathano hoy vs accepted job” ba “koto clients ache vs freelancer” etc. Exact number nai, tai estimate hocche:

* Upwork: Django/React stack freelancer jodi active profile thaken, every 20-30 ta proposal pathale maybe **1-2 job** pabar chance thakte pare. (Reddit anecdote moto)
* Fiverr: Apni gig publish korle, ja styled “Django/React web app”, client immediate order dite pare. Kintu gig ke popular korte, review build korte somoy lagbe. Shohoje bolte gele, initial stage e client pawa slower hote pare.
